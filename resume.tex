        \begin{rSubsection} {NASA Student Launch Rocketry Competition} {September 2018 - Present} {Chief Engineer of Payload}

            \item Collaborating with Project Manager in leading the development of an air deployed autonomous quadrotor intended to deploy from a rocket during descent. Aircraft is tasked to execute a simulated ice sample retrieval mission.
            \item Working with the Navio2 platform for hard real time IO coupled with a Raspberry Pi running the open source Ardupilot flight stack for autonomous guidance navigation and control.
            \item Implementing computer vision algorithms in C++ to run on the Raspberry Pi which will detect and guide the UAV's descent towards the ice retrieval site.
            % \item Determined requirements and constraints of said CV algorithms and evaluated their implementations based on factors such as computational overhead, reliability, accuracy, and risk of interfering with the Ardupilot flight stack.
            \item Applying software-in-the-loop methods using Ardupilot-SITL and Gazebo as a physics engine to thoroughly test corner cases and validate software reliability.
            \item Formulating a development, manufacturing, and testing schedule for software and structural components of the aircraft.
